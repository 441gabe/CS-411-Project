# CS-411-Project

Scooter rental system that uses object-oriented-programming to provide the user a selection of electric scooters to rent.
Instructions are provided on the command line where a user can log in with an existing account,
    or register a new account.

Users log in or register their account, then are prompted to either reserve, return, or search if scooters are available to rent.

Administrators have access to tracking scooter availability, and the scooters that have been reserved by other users.
