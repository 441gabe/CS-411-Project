login and registration...
----------------------------------------------------------------
login first:
    use dictionaries to house the user id, password, and other relevant information
        dict key is username
        dict values are (username, password, name, email, phone)
    maybe add a cute lil secret code to change password if the user forgets it
    
    so, 
    saving stuff in a dictionary outside of the host user
        save stuff in a text file in a google drive or something, rewrite and..
        ..read from the text file each time it goes into the main runfile again
    
    registration:
        individual prompts with confirm prompts with that too
        only first time users, if a user ID already exists with..
        ..the same code that the user wants, then deny (randomly generated code?)
        
        wtf am i doing with this lmao
